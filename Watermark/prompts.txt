When the sun rises
After the rain stops
Before he could answer
Just as she arrived
In case it rains
As soon as they left
Whenever she feels happy
Because he was late
Until the light fades
While they were laughing
If he only knew
Once the storm clears
After the call ended
Unless she agrees to
During the busy season
So that he could understand
With a smile on her face
Without saying a word
As long as we wait
In order to succeed
On the edge of town
Between the lines of text
If the door remains open
By the time they noticed
Despite the cold weather
Underneath the tall trees
Near the bustling market
Beyond the horizon line
For the sake of peace
According to the plan
